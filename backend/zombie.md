Structure for Routes
For your MERN stack blog application with an admin dashboard and subscriber functionality, you'll need a set of routes for both the backend (Express/Node.js) and frontend (React). Here's a suggested list of routes for both:

Backend (Express/Node.js) Routes:
Authentication Routes:
POST /api/auth/login - Login for both admin and subscribers.
POST /api/auth/register - Register new subscribers.
POST /api/auth/logout - Logout for both admin and subscribers.
Admin Routes:
GET /api/admin/dashboard - Get admin dashboard data.
POST /api/admin/post - Create a new blog post.
PUT /api/admin/post/:postId - Update a blog post.
DELETE /api/admin/post/:postId - Delete a blog post.
GET /api/admin/subscribers - Get all subscribers.
PUT /api/admin/subscriber/:subscriberId - Update a subscriber's profile.
DELETE /api/admin/subscriber/:subscriberId - Delete a subscriber.
Subscriber Routes:
GET /api/subscriber/dashboard - Get subscriber dashboard data.
GET /api/subscriber/posts - Get all blog posts (standard and premium) for subscribers.
GET /api/subscriber/post/:postId - Get details of a specific blog post.
PUT /api/subscriber/profile - Update subscriber profile.
DELETE /api/subscriber/account - Delete subscriber account.
Frontend (React) Routes:
Admin Routes:
/admin/dashboard - Admin dashboard.
/admin/posts - List of all blog posts with options to edit and delete.
/admin/posts/new - Create a new blog post.
/admin/posts/edit/:postId - Edit a specific blog post.
/admin/subscribers - List of all subscribers with options to edit and delete.
Subscriber Routes:
/dashboard - Subscriber dashboard.
/posts - List of all blog posts (standard and premium).
/posts/:postId - View a specific blog post.
/profile - Edit subscriber profile.
/account - Delete subscriber account.
Authentication Routes:
/login - Login page.

These routes should provide a foundation for your MERN stack blog application. Make sure to implement proper authentication middleware to secure routes that require authentication. Additionally, consider handling authorization to ensure that only the admin has access to certain functionalities.
